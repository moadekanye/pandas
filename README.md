In my analysis of the Iris dataset, I found that the Versicolor and Virginica species are the most similar. Their average measurements for petal length and width are very close, which means they look quite alike. On the other hand, Setosa is the least similar species because it has much smaller petals compared to Versicolor and Virginica. This makes it easier to tell Setosa apart from the other two species based on its size.

The purpose of this project was to look at the physical traits of different iris species to see how they compare. I combined data on petal and sepal measurements, then calculated averages, medians, and standard deviations for each species. This analysis helps highlight the differences among the species.
